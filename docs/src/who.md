# Who is behind this?

ðŸ‘‹ I'm [jbr](https://github.com/jbr). I've been working on tide,
async-h1, and http-types for the last year, and have landed a number
of exciting features in that framework such as sessions, unix socket
listeners, tls, and websockets. I've also done a bunch of work in
tide's http implementation, async-h1. Trillium is the direct product
of that experience. I am continuing to contribute to http-rs, but as
tide's design stabilizes, I am branching out in order to explore a
number of alternative designs that I have been considering for the
majority of the last year.

As such, some of the documentation will reference tide. I also have
substantial experience with node/express, koa, phoenix, sinatra, and
rails, and will try to incorporate references to those frameworks
where appropriate to provide touchstones.
