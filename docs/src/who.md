# Who is behind this?

Hi, I'm [jbr](https://github.com/jbr). I'm currently the sole author
of myco, but hopefully that will change over time. I've been working
on tide, async-h1, and http-types for the last year, and have landed a
number of exciting features in that framework, such as sessions, unix
socket listeners, tls, and websockets. I've also done a bunch of work
in tide's http implementation, async-h1. Myco is the direct product of
that experience. I am continuing to contribute to http-rs, but as
tide's design stabilizes, I am branching out in order to explore a
number of alternative designs that I have been considering for the
majority of the last year.

As such, some of the documentation will describe differences from
tide.
