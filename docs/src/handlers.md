# A tour of some of the handlers that exist today

In order for trillium to be a usable web framework, we offer a number of
core utilities. However, it is our hope that alternative
implementations for at least some of these will exist in order to
explore the design space and accommodate different design constraints
and tradeoffs. Because not every application will need this
functionality, they are each released as distinct libraries from the
core of trillium.
