# Welcome

Hi! Welcome to the documentation for trillium, a modular toolkit for
building async rust web applications.

## Who is this document for?

This document expects some familiarity with async rust. We intend to
offer a beginner level document at some point, but for now we
recommend looking at [the rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
and [the async book](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/).

We also assume familiarity with web development in general, including
concepts and patterns in http servers and frameworks.

In particular, we offer comparisons to rust's
[tide](https://github.com/http-rs/tide) and elixir's
[phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) /
[plug](https://hexdocs.pm/plug/readme.html), as they serve as the
primary inspirations for trillium.
