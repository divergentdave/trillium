# Just show me some code!

[here's a kitchen-sink example app](https://github.com/trillium-rs/trillium/blob/main/example/src/main.rs). It makes use of the smol-based server, the router, cookies, sessions, websockets, the devlogger, and the static file server, but it doesn't really make any cohesive sense yet

[here's a similar example that can be deployed as an aws lambda](https://github.com/trillium-rs/trillium/blob/main/aws-lambda-example/src/main.rs). The actual content is very similar to the kitchen-sink example app, and that's the point. With few exceptions, a trillium app that runs directly will also run in aws lambda.

  > I'm not certain if I'm going to publish this as part of trillium, as it is !Send and that requires some more design for cross-runtime compat. It's fun that it works for reverse proxies, though.
